# IIUM-Microcredential

#### ***Project Objective:***
To develop a complete Micro-credential system for International Islamic University Malaysia.

#### ***Project Description:***
IIUM Micro-credentials are brief qualifications recognized by the Sejahtera Academic Framework (SAF) that show a person's proficiency in a certain field or aptitude. Micro-credentials, also referred to as nano degrees, have a more limited scope than conventional credentials like diplomas or degrees. However, they might also have a broad rather than a narrow emphasis. One micro-credential could be for something as broad as data-driven marketing, while another could be more narrowly focused on how to empower others at work.

#### ***Contribution:***
With this project, my internship experience started. I participated in this project as an intern with the development team. My team handled the development of a learning management system (LMS) using Moodle, PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to launch the university's Microcredential. In addition to certain back-end and ad hoc cloud activities, I worked mostly on the project's QA and front end part. Within the internship term, our team was unable to complete the project.
